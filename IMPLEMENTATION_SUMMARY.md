### Key Features Implemented

#### ✅ Advanced GUI Application (`modpack_doctor_gui.py`)
- **Left Panel**: Treeview with mod icons, colored status indicators, and sortable columns
- **Search & Filters**: Real-time search with severity toggles and loader filtering
- **Right Panel**: Detailed mod information with description and issue breakdown
- **Toolbar**: Full feature set including analyze, export, cache management, JVM dialog
- **Action Buttons**: Bulk operations for disabling duplicates, conflicts, and errors
- **Context Menu**: Right-click actions for individual mod management
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking analysis with progress indicators

#### ✅ Comprehensive Analysis Engine
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies same mod with different versions
- **Loader Mismatch**: Detects mixed Fabric/Forge/Quilt/NeoForge environments
- **Known Conflicts**: Pre-configured conflict database (Sodium vs Rubidium, OptiFine vs Sodium, etc.)
- **Dependency Analysis**: Missing dependencies and version mismatches
- **MC Version Compatibility**: Cross-mod Minecraft version consistency
- **Pre-release Detection**: Identifies alpha/beta/snapshot versions
- **Plugin System**: Extensible rules (e.g., large file detection >50MB)

#### ✅ Mod Format Support
- **Fabric**: Complete `fabric.mod.json` parsing with dependencies
- **Quilt**: Native `quilt.mod.json` support
- **Forge/NeoForge**: Full `META-INF/mods.toml` parsing with version ranges
- **Icon Extraction**: Automatic icon detection and caching
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Modrinth API integration for enhanced descriptions

#### ✅ Performance & Caching
- **SHA256 Fingerprinting**: File-based caching for fast re-analysis
- **Persistent Cache**: User directory cache (`~/.modpack-doctor/cache`)
- **Icon Caching**: PNG icon storage with automatic resizing
- **Background Processing**: Multi-threaded analysis without UI blocking

#### ✅ System Integration
- **Hardware Detection**: CPU, RAM, OS identification via psutil
- **JVM Optimization**: Intelligent memory allocation and G1GC tuning
- **File Management**: Cross-platform mod disable/enable operations
- **Explorer Integration**: Open mod locations in system file manager

#### ✅ Build & Distribution
- **Windows Executable**: PyInstaller configuration for single-file EXE
- **Build Scripts**: PowerShell and Batch scripts for local building
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
- **Dependency Management**: Complete requirements.txt specification

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Core Functionality Validation
```
✅ All core modules import successfully
✅ Settings loaded: 7 keys
✅ Hardware detection: Linux with 4 cores
✅ Directory scan: found 0 mods
✅ Analysis complete: 0 issues found
✅ Report generated: 451 characters
```

### Analysis Engine Testing
```
Testing analysis with mock data...
✅ Analysis found 2 issues
  - error: Mod uses forge loader, but primary loader is fabric
  - error: Sodium and Rubidium are incompatible (both are rendering optimizers)
✅ Generated report with 1732 characters
🎉 Mock analysis test passed!
```

## 📋 Requirements Compliance

### ✅ All Specified Deliverables Implemented
